# Fortunes-Fun
C++ version is from:
http://blog.ivank.net/fortunes-algorithm-and-implementation.html
just embeded in an Xcode project that will build/run on OSX 10.10.3 currently

Swift version is the c++ translated and stuck in a super super simple and inefficient iOS application.
all of the Voronoi generation is in it's own framework and is as fast as the c++. the inefficiencies are the drawing of it.
